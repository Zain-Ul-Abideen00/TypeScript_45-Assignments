# Exercise 01: Installation of Node.js, TypeScript, and VS Code

This exercise involves setting up the development environment by installing Node.js, TypeScript, and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your computer.

## Steps to Install

### 1. Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is required to run JavaScript code outside the browser.

- Download the Node.js installer from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
- Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

### 2. Install TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

- Install TypeScript globally using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```
- Verify the installation by running the following command:
  ```bash
  tsc -v
  ```

### 3. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- Download VS Code from the [official VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
- After installation, open VS Code.

### Additional Configuration

#### Install VS Code Extensions

To enhance your development experience, install the following extensions:

- **ESLint**: Lints your TypeScript code.
- **Prettier**: Formats your code consistently.
- **TypeScript**: Provides TypeScript support.

You can install these extensions from the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac) in VS Code.

## Summary

By completing this exercise, you have set up the essential tools required to develop and run TypeScript applications. In the subsequent exercises, you will write and execute TypeScript code using this setup.
