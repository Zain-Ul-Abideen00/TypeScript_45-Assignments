/*Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, 
cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.*/

// Storing a list of cities in an array
let cities: string[] = ["Kashmir", "Venice", "Zurich", "Skardu", "Hunza"];

// Printing the array
cities.forEach(city => console.log(city));
